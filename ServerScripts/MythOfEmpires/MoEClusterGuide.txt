MoE Cluster Server Configuration on Windows Server 2022:
*Note: this guide should work fine for normal windows as well*

## Server Prep ##
# Things to Install/Download #
- Powershell Core (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- SteamCMD (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Ubuntu 20.04 (for the purpose of this tutorial)

**Install WSL/Ubuntu**
*We need a REDIS Instance but these can't be natively hosted on windows, so we need to install WSL.*
- Make sure your system is up to date
- open powershell core (Start->Run->pwsh)
- type ``` Install-WindowsFeature -Name Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux -Restart ``` and hit enter (This will reboot your server)
- open powershell core again and type ``` wsl --update ```
- type ``` wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04 ```
- Reboot server again
- Now if you open start menu and type "Ubuntu" you should have an App show up. Launch it. This will finish the install of Ubuntu. Please follow the prompts, your ubuntu install on WSL is now completed. 

**Install Redis**
*https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/install-redis-on-windows/*
- Launch Ubuntu App
- Follow the instructions on the provided link.
*I'll paste it here but please reference the url provided as this could change overtime*
```
curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis

sudo service redis-server start
```

** Install Myth of Empires Dedicated Server **
- Using Powershell and SteamCMD
- & "C:\PATH\TO\STEAMCMD.exe" +force_install_dir "C:\PATH\TO\FOLDER" +login anonymous +app_update 1794810 validate +quit

- Now On your client machine, browse to your MoE Client folder and run the Matrix Server tool and fill out all the fun information

- SceneServer RemotePassword: RCON Password
- SceneServer MaxPlayers: Straight forward.
- Hit Save Scene Server.
- Change the ID +1 and hit ADD to create a second node in the cluster. Proceed to fill out the information. Make sure to not use the same ports

** Database Config **
- For now don't use this. There's a weird TLS Issue with MySQL, you can leave this as is. 

- Now go to Start Console -> Save Config
- If you are using my powershell script, copy the "ServerParamConfig_All.ini" to <YOUR_SERVER_INSTALL>\configs
- If you are not using my script, the tool would have generated a series of BAT files. You just need to copy these over to your server, update the path in them to your MOEServer.exe and then run each of them.
